# EDA-on-Garment-Productivity
1. This research, based on a Kaggle dataset, explores the application of five machine-learning algorithms and a stacking ensemble technique to predict garment worker productivity. 
2. We evaluate Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function, XGBoost Regressor, Gradient Boost Regressor, and Stacking through five error metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and R-squared error.
3. The analysis includes a comparison with existing research and a demonstration of hyperparameter tuning for attaining the best-performing model.
4. The results reveal that the stacking ensemble model achieves the lowest error values, particularly an MAE of 0.04, RMSE of 0.09, and R-squared error of 0.65, outperforming individual ML algorithms.
